  1. **What is Vastu Shastra?** — Brief explanation: ancient Indian science of spatial arrangement; directional energies and five elements.
  2. **Do I need to break walls or renovate for Vastu corrections?** — Key objection; answer: no, 90%+ of corrections are non-demolition (colours, placement, mirrors, plants, salt bowls).
  3. **Is Vastu only for Hindus?** — Clarify it's a universal spatial science, not religion-specific.
  4. **How is Astro-Vastu different from regular Vastu?** — Explains premium service; birth chart influences optimal space layout.
  5. **Do you offer online consultations?** — Yes; floor plan / photos via WhatsApp or Google Meet; serving PAN India.
  6. **How long does it take to see results?** — Typical timeline: 30–90 days for subtle energetic shifts; major changes faster.
  7. **What information do I need to provide?** — For Vastu: floor plan, compass bearing, plot direction. For Astrology: exact birth date, time, and place.
  8. **What is your consultation fee?** — Link to contact/pricing page; note pricing is on request for custom consultations.
- **SEO note:** FAQ answers should be 2–4 sentences each, written naturally. Google may feature these in rich snippets.
- **TBD:** [ ] Review and confirm all answers with consultant before publishing
- **Implementation:** Replace all existing FAQ items array in `index.astro` `<FAQs>` widget

---

### Sprint 9: Contact/Booking Section + Final CTA
- **Goal:** Make booking frictionless — the page must end with a clear, compelling action path.

  - Props:
    - `title`: _"Ready to Transform Your Space and Life?"_
    - `subtitle`: _"Join 100+ happy families and businesses across Bangalore. Book your personalised consultation today."_

  - [ ] Choose form submission backend (Netlify Forms recommended)
  - [ ] Add WhatsApp number for quick-contact button

---

### Sprint 10: Footer + Blog Setup
- **Goal:** Finalise the footer with real links, and decide on blog strategy — blog content is one of the strongest local SEO levers for a consultant.
- **Section A — Footer (already partially done in Sprint 2, needs TBD items):**
  - **TBD:**
    - [ ] Add Instagram URL (replace `#`)
    - [ ] Add Facebook URL (replace `#`)
    - [ ] Add YouTube URL if applicable (replace `#`)
    - [ ] Confirm Google Business Profile and add link if applicable
  - Footer structure is correct — no code changes needed beyond social links
- **Section B — Blog (`BlogLatestPosts.astro`):**
  - Currently shows generic AstroWind blog intro — update or remove
  - **If blog is planned:** Update `BlogLatestPosts` with:
    - `title`: _"Vastu & Astrology Insights"_
    - `information`: _"Practical tips, seasonal guidance, and case studies to bring harmony to your home and clarity to your life."_
    - **Suggested first blog post topics (TBD — write after launch):**
      1. _"5 Non-Demolition Vastu Tips for Your Bangalore Flat"_ (targets high-volume local keyword)
      2. _"What Your Main Door Direction Means — Vastu Guide for Homeowners"_
      3. _"Astrology Muhurta: The Best Time to Start a New Business in 2026"_
      4. _"How Astro-Vastu Helped a Koramangala Startup Triple Revenue"_ (case study)
  - **If no blog for now:** Remove `<BlogLatestPosts>` from `index.astro` to avoid empty/template content
  - **TBD:** [ ] Decide blog strategy · [ ] Write first 2 posts before launch for SEO traction

---

## Page Section Order (Final Design)
The final `index.astro` page should follow this order:
1. `Hero` — Consultant intro, photo, credentials, CTAs
2. `ServiceCards` — 6 service cards with links ✅
3. `Note` — Mission statement
4. `Content (About)` — Consultant bio with photo
5. `Steps` — How a consultation works (5 steps)
6. `Features2` — Core values (6 values)
7. `Testimonials` — 3–5 client stories
8. `Stats` — Social proof numbers
9. `FAQs` — 8 questions
10. `BlogLatestPosts` — (optional; keep or remove)
11. `CallToAction` — Final booking CTA

---

## General Notes
- All TBD sections are marked with comments in code for easy future updates.
- Use placeholder images/text where real content is not yet available.
- Ensure all sections are mobile-friendly and visually consistent.
- Document any new components or widgets created for future agents.
- **SEO priorities:** Every page should have a unique `<title>` and `<meta description>`. Use location keywords (Bangalore, Whitefield, Koramangala, HSR Layout) naturally in headings and body. Add `schema.org/LocalBusiness` structured data once content is finalised.
- **WhatsApp CTA:** A floating WhatsApp button is a high-conversion element for Indian audiences — prioritise adding it in Sprint 9.
- **Performance:** All images must use the existing `Image.astro` component for automatic optimisation. No raw `<img>` tags.
